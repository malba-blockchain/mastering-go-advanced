/*
The goal of this activity is to explore the use of threads by creating a program for sorting integers that uses four goroutines to create four sub-arrays and then merge the arrays into a single array

Write a program to sort an array of integers. The program should partition the array into 4 parts, each of which is sorted by a different goroutine. Each partition should be of approximately equal size. Then the main goroutine should merge the 4 sorted subarrays into one large sorted array.

The program should prompt the user to input a series of integers. Each goroutine which sorts Â¼ of the array should print the subarray that it will sort. When sorting is complete, the main goroutine should print the entire sorted list.

Students will receive five points if the program sorts the integers and five additional points if there are four goroutines that each prints out a set of array elements that it is storing.
